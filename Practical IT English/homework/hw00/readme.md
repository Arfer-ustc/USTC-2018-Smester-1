####	简介

*	书名, When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing

	(Timing, 时机的选择, 什么时候该做什么事)

*	作者, Daniel H. Pink 

*	豆瓣链接, https://book.douban.com/subject/27182263/

*	内容简介

	Everyone knows that timing is everything. But we don't know much about timing itself. Our lives are a never-ending stream of "when" decisions: when to start a business, schedule a class, get serious about a person. Yet we make those decisions based on intuition and guesswork.

	Timing, it's often assumed, is an art. In When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing, Pink shows that timing is really a science.

	Drawing on a rich trove of research from psychology, biology, and economics, Pink reveals how best to live, work, and succeed. How can we use the hidden patterns of the day to build the ideal schedule? Why do certain breaks dramatically improve student test scores? How can we turn a stumbling beginning into a fresh start? Why should we avoid going to the hospital in the afternoon? Why is singing in time with other people as good for you as exercise? And what is the ideal time to quit a job, switch careers, or get married?

	In When, Pink distills cutting-edge research and data on timing and synthesizes them into a fascinating, readable narrative packed with irresistible stories and practical takeaways that give readers compelling insights into how we can live richer, more engaged lives.

	Timing is when to make decisions.

	This book covers a lot of science. You'll read about plenty of studies.

	But this is also a practical book. At the end of each chapter is what I call a “Time Hacker’s Handbook,” a collection of tools, exercises, and tips to help put the insights into action.

<br>

####	1. Introduction: Captain Turner's decision

*	About a hundred years ago, a great liner sailing from US to England was devastated by German U-submarines. There are many speculations behind the tragedy, like this was a conspiracy that Britain intentionally did this to drag the US into the war.

	However, maybe Captain Turner just made some bad decisions. And maybe those decisions were bad because he made them in the afternoon, which is a bad time to make decisions, according to the author.

	讲故事, 引出观点。1915年5月，一战期间，一艘由美国Manhattan开往英国Liverpool的船，被德国的U-submarines击沉了，

	这次事故造成了很多影响，其中之一就是使美国加入了战争。因此有很多人认为，这是英国的阴谋，想借此把美国拉进战争当中

	不过本书作者认为，也许事实很简单，就是Captain Turner 做出这一系列错误决定（包括加到最大马力、花了更长时间进行定位）的时间是在下午，（中午不睡，下午崩溃）

*	Anyway, that story leads to the main topic of this book --- Timing.

	We all know that timing is everything.

	But most people make decisions out of intuition and guesswork. That is, they think timing is an art.

	In the author's view, timing is a science.

	然后开始展开，大部分人认为timing是一种art，一种intuition, 但作者认为timing是一种science，

*	To begin with, we start our inquiry with time itself. We first study the history of time, like

	*	the first sundials in ancient Egypt, 日晷
	*	early mechanical clocks, in the 16th century, 机械钟
	*	the advent of time zones, in the 19th century, 时区

	those are tools to define and calculate time.

	为了说明Timing是一种科学，作者 start with time itself, 看看我们是如何定义时间的

<br>

####	2. The Hidden Pattern of Everyday Life (生物钟)

*	Then there's an interesting study made by two Cornell University sociologists.

	They studied more than 500 million tweets that 2.4 million users in eighty-four countries posted over a two-year period to measure people's emotions.

	两位 Cornell 大学的社会学家，研究了 5 亿条推特，从中发现了一些规律(模式, pattern)

*	Findings / Patterns:

	![twitter-based-emotion-study](https://github.com/jJayyyyyyy/USTC-2018-Smester-1/blob/master/Practical%20IT%20English/homework/hw00/assets/twitter-based-emotion-study.jpg)

	*	positive / negative emotions vary over time, 情绪会随时间变化
	*	morning: active, engaged, and hopeful, 早上积极
	*	in the afternoon, drop, 中午开始下降
	*	in the early evening, climbed back up again, 傍晚开始回升
	*	Positive affect was generally a bit higher on Saturdays and Sundays, 周末情绪更好
	*	The temporal affective pattern is similarly shaped across disparate cultures and geographic locations. 不同地区、不同文化，总体趋势相同

*	The patterns above are related to biological clocks, which control the rise and fall of our body temperature, regulates our hormones.

	上述规律和生物钟有关

	Just like that plant, our physical and mental status open and close regularly, which can guide us on how we can configure our own daily lives.

	和含羞草一样，一天当中，人的生理心理状态也会随着时间改变

*	Another group of researchers have found some similar patterns using DRM(Day Reconstruction Method).

	另一份研究也展示了和twitter-based emotion study类似的结果

	People feel increasingly happy throughout the morning, less happy in the afternoon, and happier again in the evening, just like the findings from.

	It also showed that during any given day people typically are least happy while commuting and most happy while canoodling.

	上下班挤公交的时候不开心，canoodling/kiss的时候最开心

	![DRM1](https://github.com/jJayyyyyyy/USTC-2018-Smester-1/blob/master/Practical%20IT%20English/homework/hw00/assets/DRM1.jpg)

	![DRM2](https://github.com/jJayyyyyyy/USTC-2018-Smester-1/blob/master/Practical%20IT%20English/homework/hw00/assets/DRM2.jpg)

	![DRM3](https://github.com/jJayyyyyyy/USTC-2018-Smester-1/blob/master/Practical%20IT%20English/homework/hw00/assets/DRM3.jpg)

<br>

####	3. There are More examples to prove those patterns.

*	1. Linda Problem

	> Which is more likely?
	> a. Linda is a bank teller.
	> b. Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.

	省略了相关背景描述，这个描述是说Linda是个很开朗乐观的姑娘，也就是说，这个背景描述是想混淆视听让你选b的

	答案是a，因为a更加宽泛, more likely, 而b是a的子集, 增加了更多限制, 使得可能性下降了

	Researchers have posed the Linda problem at different times of day, 

	People were much more likely to get it right earlier in the day than later.

	Performance was generally strong in the beginning of the day, then worsened as the hours ticked by.

	研究者发现, 人们在早上更容易得出正确答案

*	2. Stereotypes

	A German psychologist found that people learned and remembered strings of nonsense syllables more effectively in the morning than at night.

	大致是说, 给定几组拼写类似的名字, 在早上更容易区分清楚

*	3. Scores of students

	researches from Danish and LA schools also show that students get higher score in the morning.

	在早上, 学生拿到的分数比下午的高

*	But, not all brainwork is the same. innovation and creativity are greatest when we are not at our best

	但是，并非所有问题都适合上午做。研究发现，某些创造性的活动, 在下午进行(当我们处于low emotion status 的时候)，效果更好

*	In short, our moods and performance oscillate during the day. For most of us, mood follows a common pattern: a peak, a trough, and a rebound.

	总结, 大多数人, 一天中都会经历情绪的几个变化阶段

<br>

####	4. LARKS, OWLS, AND THIRD BIRDS

*	Not all Human beings experience a day in the same way.

	大致有三类人群, 人数大致服从高斯分布

	there is a Gaussian distribution of larks, owls, third birds

	![birds](https://github.com/jJayyyyyyy/USTC-2018-Smester-1/blob/master/Practical%20IT%20English/homework/hw00/assets/birds.jpg)

	In short, all of us experience the day in three stages, a peak, a trough, and a rebound. But not all of us has the same biological clock. It's a good idea to find one that suit yourself.

	总之，每个人的节奏不一样，但是总体都会在一天中经历这样一个起伏的过程

<br>

####	5. Time Hacker's Handbook

*	1. HOW TO FIGURE OUT YOUR DAILY-WHEN: A THREE-STEP METHOD

	*	First, determine your chronotype: lark / owl / third bird, 先确定你是哪一类人

	*	Second, determine what you need to do. Analysis / Creation, Insight, 再确定你要做哪一类工作

	*	Look up the table, 根据下表查看合适的工作时间

		![Daily-When-Chart](https://github.com/jJayyyyyyy/USTC-2018-Smester-1/blob/master/Practical%20IT%20English/homework/hw00/assets/Daily-When-Chart.jpg)

*	2. More precise and accurate way to get your daily-when, 更加精确的方式

	*	track your behavior systematically for a week. 系统地跟踪记录一周的活动

		Set your phone alarm to beep every ninety minutes. 每隔90分钟回答记录下面的问题

		Each time you hear the alarm, answer these three questions:

		*	What are you doing, 你在做什么
		*	On a scale of 1 to 10, how mentally alert do you feel right now? 精神状态如何(1~10分)
		*	On a scale of 1 to 10, how physically energetic do you feel right now? 身体状态如何(1~10分)

*	3. WHAT TO DO IF YOU DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER YOUR DAILY SCHEDULE

	*	The harsh reality is that many of us don't have fully control of our time. For that, there are two strategies to minimize the harm, 现实很残酷, 每个人很难完全掌控自己的时间, 采取下面的方式, 可能会减少负面作用

		*	Be aware. 意识到自己没有处于最佳状态

			Simply knowing that you’re operating at a suboptimal time can be helpful because you can correct for your chronotype in small but powerful ways.

			prepare in advance, take a walk and relax, help sb, repeat other's question

			提前做好准备, 放松, 帮助他人, 在回答问题之前先重复别人的问题, 确保自己没有听错

		*	Work the margins

			Even if you can’t control the big things, you might still be able to shape the little things.

			If you have an free hour in the morning, don't waste it on emails. Take it to do the most important work.

			充分利用时间, 不要把自己的最佳时间浪费在查看邮件等琐碎的事情上

*	4. WHEN TO EXERCISE: THE ULTIMATE GUIDE, 什么时候去运动

	*	The answer depends in part on your goals. 取决于你的目标

	*	Morning: Lose weight, boost mood, keep a routine, build strength

		早上: 减肥, 激活新的一天, 日常打卡

	*	Afternoon, evening: avoid injury, perform your best, enjoy the workout a bit more

		下午和晚上: 避免受伤(下午身体已经充分活动开了), 激烈运动, 充分享受运动的快乐

*	5. four TIPS FOR A BETTER MORNING

	*	Drink a glass of water when you wake up, 起床之后喝水
	*	Don’t drink coffee immediately after you wake up. 别喝咖啡(or 奶茶)
	*	Soak up the morning sun. 沐浴阳光
	*	Schedule talk-therapy appointments for the morning. 如果要看病, 最好早上去, 状态更好, 吸收更好

<br>

####	6. 摘录

*	Time isn’t the main thing. It’s the only thing.

*	[Intro] Seconds, hours, and weeks are all human inventions. Only by marking them off, wrote historian Daniel Boorstin, "would mankind be liberated from the cyclical monotony of nature."

*	[1] Moods are an internal state, but they have an external impact.

*	[40.5, ] When we wake up, our body temperature slowly rises. That rising temperature gradually boosts our energy level and alertness, and that, in turn, enhances our executive functioning, our ability to concentrate, and our powers of deduction. 

	Alertness and energy levels, which climb in the morning and reach their apex around noon, tend to plummet during the afternoons. And with that drop comes a corresponding fall in our ability to remain focused

*	[42.6, ] having math in the first two periods of the school day instead of the last two periods increases the math GPA of students

*	[47.7, ]Thomas Edison was a night owl who enabled other night owls.
