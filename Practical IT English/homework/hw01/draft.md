When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing
时机的选择

作者
Daniel H. Pink 

内容简介
Everyone knows that timing is everything. But we don't know much about timing itself. Our lives are a never-ending stream of "when" decisions: when to start a business, schedule a class, get serious about a person. Yet we make those decisions based on intuition and guesswork.

Timing, it's often assumed, is an art. In When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing, Pink shows that timing is really a science.

Drawing on a rich trove of research from psychology, biology, and economics, Pink reveals how best to live, work, and succeed. How can we use the hidden patterns of the day to build the ideal schedule? Why do certain breaks dramatically improve student test scores? How can we turn a stumbling beginning into a fresh start? Why should we avoid going to the hospital in the afternoon? Why is singing in time with other people as good for you as exercise? And what is the ideal time to quit a job, switch careers, or get married?

In When, Pink distills cutting-edge research and data on timing and synthesizes them into a fascinating, readable narrative packed with irresistible stories and practical takeaways that give readers compelling insights into how we can live richer, more engaged lives.

##	Introduction: Captain Turner's decision

讲故事, 1915年5月，一战期间，一艘由美国Manhattan开往英国Liverpool的船，被德国的U-submarines击沉了，

这次事故造成了很多影响，其中之一就是使美国加入了战争。因此有很多人认为，这是英国的阴谋，想借此把美国拉进战争当中

不过本书作者认为，也许事实很简单，就是Captain Turner做出这一系列错误决定（包括加到最大马力、花了更长时间进行定位）的时间是在下午，（中午不睡，下午崩溃）

Maybe Captain Turner just made some bad decisions. And maybe those decisions were bad because he made them in the afternoon.


然后开始展开，原来人们认为timing是一种art，一种intuition, 但作者认为timing是一种science，

*	We all know that timing is everything. Timing is when to make decisions.

	But most people make decisions out of intuition and guesswork. That is, they think timing is an art.

*	But in the author's opinion, timing is a science.

	This book covers a lot of science. You’ll read about plenty of studies,

	But this is also a practical book. At the end of each chapter is what I call a “Time Hacker’s Handbook,” a collection of tools, exercises, and tips to help put the insights into action.

*	为了说明Timing是一种科学，作者 start with time itself, 我们是如何定义时间的

	So where do we begin?

	The place to start our inquiry is with time itself. Study the history of time

	*	the first sundials in ancient Egypt
	*	early mechanical clocks, in the 16th century
	*	the advent of time zones, in the 19th century

	tool to define and calculate time.

通过一系列方法，可以使我们更好地做出决策，完成任务

为什么


*	two Cornell University sociologists,
	
	studied more than 500 million tweets that 2.4 million users in eighty-four countries posted over a two-year period.

	measure people’s emotions

	positive / negative emotions vary over time 

*	Findings:

	morning: active, engaged, and hopeful

	in the afternoon, drop

	in the early evening, climbed back up again

	Positive affect was generally a bit higher on Saturdays and Sundays

	img1.bmp

	The temporal affective pattern is similarly shaped across disparate cultures and geographic locations.

*	为了解释这种现象, 先举了个例子, 进而引出生物钟

	To understand this pattern—where it comes from and what it means—begins with a potted plant, a Mimosa pudica, 含羞草

	a French astronomer, noticed that the leaves unfurled in the morning and furled as darkness loomed. no matter there is light or not.

	and later on, researchers found there nearly all living things have biological clocks.

	对于人类来说，在下丘脑有一块组织SCN，控制着我们的生物钟, controls the rise and fall of our body temperature, regulates our hormones

	和含羞草一样，人的生理心理状态也会 open and close regularly, which can guide us on how we can configure our own daily lives.

*	Another research producted by DRM has shown that during any given day people typically are least happy while commuting and most happy while canoodling.

	同时，DRM has found that people feel increasingly happy throughout the morning, less happy in the afternoon, and happier again in the evening, just like img1

	when they are happier, they feel warmer

	(a research from DRM has indicated some similar patterns.)


*	Linda问题，When researchers have posed the Linda problem at different times of day, 

	People were much more likely to get it right earlier in the day than later.

	performance was generally strong in the beginning of the day, then worsened as the hours ticked by.

*	A German psychologist found that people learned and remembered strings of nonsense syllables more effectively in the morning than at night.

	researches from Danish and LA schools also show that students get higher score in the morning.

*	But, not all brainwork is the same. innovation and creativity are greatest when we are not at our best

*	In short, our moods and performance oscillate during the day. For most of us, mood follows a common pattern: a peak, a trough, and a rebound.

##	LARKS, OWLS, AND THIRD BIRDS

*	Human beings don’t all experience a day in precisely the same way.

	there is a Gaussian distribution of larks, owls, third birds

	In short, all of us experience the day in three stages—a peak, a trough, and a rebound. But not all of us has the same biological clock. It's a good idea to find one that suit yourself.

##	Time Hacker's Handbook

1.	HOW TO FIGURE OUT YOUR DAILY WHEN: A THREE-STEP METHOD

	*	First, determine your chronotype: lark / owl / third bird

	*	Second, determine what you need to do. Analysis / Creation, Insight

	*	Look up the table [64.9, img2]

2.	More precise and accurate way to get your daily when

	*	track your behavior systematically for a week.

		Set your phone alarm to beep every ninety minutes. 

		Each time you hear the alarm, answer these three questions:

		*	What are you doing
		*	On a scale of 1 to 10, how mentally alert do you feel right now?
		*	On a scale of 1 to 10, how physically energetic do you feel right now?

3.	WHAT TO DO IF YOU DON’T HAVE CONTROL OVER YOUR DAILY SCHEDULE

*	The harsh reality is that many of us don't have fully control of our time. For that, there are two strategies to minimize the harm

	*	Be aware.

		Simply knowing that you’re operating at a suboptimal time can be helpful because you can correct for your chronotype in small but powerful ways.

		prepare in advance, take a walk and relax, help sb, repeat other's question

	*	Work the margins

		Even if you can’t control the big things, you might still be able to shape the little things.

		If you have an free hour in the morning, don't waste it on emails. Take it to do the most important work.

4.	WHEN TO EXERCISE: THE ULTIMATE GUIDE

	*	The answer depends in part on your goals.

	*	Morning: Lose weight, boost mood, keep a routine, build strength

	*	Afternoon, evening: avoid injury, perform your best, enjoy the workout a bit more

5.	4 TIPS FOR A BETTER MORNING

	*	Drink a glass of water when you wake up
	*	Don’t drink coffee immediately after you wake up.
	*	Soak up the morning sun.
	*	Schedule talk-therapy appointments for the morning.




##	摘录

*	Time isn’t the main thing. It’s the only thing.

*	[Intro] Seconds, hours, and weeks are all human inventions. Only by marking them off, wrote historian Daniel Boorstin, "would mankind be liberated from the cyclical monotony of nature."

*	[1] Moods are an internal state, but they have an external impact.

*	[40.5, ] When we wake up, our body temperature slowly rises. That rising temperature gradually boosts our energy level and alertness, and that, in turn, enhances our executive functioning, our ability to concentrate, and our powers of deduction. 

	Alertness and energy levels, which climb in the morning and reach their apex around noon, tend to plummet during the afternoons. And with that drop comes a corresponding fall in our ability to remain focused

*	[42.6, ] having math in the first two periods of the school day instead of the last two periods increases the math GPA of students

*	[47.7, ]Thomas Edison was a night owl who enabled other night owls.
